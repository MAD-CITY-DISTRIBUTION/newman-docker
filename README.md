# newman-docker

[Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) is a command-line collection runner for [Postman](http://getpostman.com). It allows you to effortlessly run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.

This repository contains docker images for Newman

Current images are

 - [Ubuntu 14.04, Newman 1.2.17](ubuntu_14_04)

# Instructions

Build the image,

```
docker build -t newman .
```

then run it

```
docker --volume="/home/elssar/collections:/etc/newman" -t newman --collection="Github.json.postman_collection" --environment="Github.postman_environment" --html="newman-report.html"
```
For newman-docker to be able to use collections and environment files saved on the host machine, and to save reports generated by newman, a directory containing the collection and environment needs to be mounted on to the docker instance on run time, preferably at `/etc/newman`, which is the default working directory. If you mount to a different location, then
  - You can either pass the full path to your collection and environment files to newman. For instance, if you mount to `/var/newman`,

```
docker --volume="/home/elssar/collection:/var/newman" -t newman --collection="/var/newman/Github.json.postman_collection" --environment="Github.postman_environment" --html="/var/newman/newman-report.html"
```
  - You can change the working directory while running the image to the location you mounted to, using the `-w` or `--workdir` flag.

```
docker --volume="/home/elssar/collections:/var/newman" --workdir="/var/newman" -t newman --collection="Github.json.postman_collection" --environment="Github.postman_environment" --html="newman-report.html"
```

In case you don't need to save newmans report to the host, and your collection is available online and it does not require any environment, then you can forgo mounting your collections directory, and directly pass the collection url to newman

```
docker -t newman --url="https://example.com/Github.json.postman_collection"
```
